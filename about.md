I'm a software engineer at Google.  I work on [Error Prone](http://github.com/google/error-prone), a bug detection
tool for Java in the vein of FindBugs.  I enjoy building tools that help developers write better code, and do it
more quickly.

Before I came to Google, I was a PhD student at Tufts University, working with [Sam
Guyer](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~sguyer). My work focused on garbage collection and dynamic analysis to detect 
memory problems.  

Please see my [Research at Google page](http://research.google.com/pubs/EdwardAftandilian.html) for a list of
publications.
